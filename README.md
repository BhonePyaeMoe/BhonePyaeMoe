## Hi there 👋

### I'm Bhone Pyae Moe(Peter)

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer who loves building web apps that are fast, responsive, and user-friendly. From designing clean, intuitive interfaces to crafting efficient back-end architectures, I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and constantly learning new tools and technologies to stay sharp in this ever-evolving field.

### 🛠️ How I Work
- Writing readable, scalable code that others can understand and build upon.
- Problem-solving mindset, breaking down complex issues into manageable steps.
- Working with modern tools and best practices, but I’m not afraid to dive into legacy code if needed.
- Thrive in collaborative environments, but I’m also comfortable flying solo when it’s time to focus.
